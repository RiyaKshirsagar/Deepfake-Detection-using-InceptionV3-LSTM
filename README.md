🎥🔊 Deeflyzer: Hybrid Deepfake Detection System
Detect deepfakes like a pro! Deeflyzer is a powerful web app that uses cutting-edge deep learning techniques to identify manipulated videos and audio files. Whether it’s a fake face or a synthetic voice, Deeflyzer has you covered! 💪

🚀 Features
Video Deepfake Detection: Extracts frames, detects faces, and classifies them as real or fake using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. 🎭
Audio Deepfake Detection: Analyzes audio files to identify fake voices using Wav2Vec2 from Hugging Face. 🎙️
Easy-to-Use Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive, interactive experience. 🖥️
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, MTCNN, Hugging Face Transformers
Languages: Python
